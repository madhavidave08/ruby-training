# EXERCISE 1
# Type a number, then by interacting with the page, work out how the number
# changes and replace the number with a new one
#
# HINT
#
# The way to type a "special" key such as up/backspace, is by referring to the symbol reference
# of the key (Name of the key preceded by a colon)

# 1) Find the number box on the page
number_box = page.number_box

# 2) Type in any odd 5 digit number i.e. 12345
number_box.send_keys('12345')
# 3) Using the up arrow, increase the number by 5
5.times {number_box.send_keys(:up)}
# 4) Find out the new number that is in the box
newvalue = number_box['value'].to_i

# 5) Delete the number and replace it with a number that is exactly half of that
5.times {number_box.send_keys(:backspace)}
number_box.send_keys("#{newvalue/2}")
# Wait and close
sleep 2
